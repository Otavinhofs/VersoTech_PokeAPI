## Project structure

### Architecture
This project was built with Clean Architecture pattern with layers `data`, `domain` and `presentation`.

### UI
The UI was built with a list screen, to user be able to see Pok√©mons with its image and names and a detail screen where you can see more information about it.
As the project uses an API to retrive information asynchronously, it was used `MOBX` to handle with main screen states: `Loading`, `Error` and `Success`

### Data serialization
To be easier to map json results from API to our model Dart class, this project uses [JSON Serialization](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/serialization/json). This avoid the need of manually map each json attribute and create our class automatically with `.fromJson()` method.
